      <h3><b>Safety</b></h3>
          	<p>For long-term storage of EUNO· (or giving as gifts) it's not safe to store your EUNO· in an exchange or online wallet. These types of sites can be hacked. Even keeping a live wallet on your own computer can be risky.</p>
            
       	  <h3><b>Your Keys, Your EUNO·.</b></h3>
          <p>By printing out your own EUNO· wallets and generating your own addresses, you can minimize your exposure to hackers as well as untrustworthy people in your home or office. Just transfer your EUNO· into your new wallets, and use common sense to keep your wallets safe the way you would jewels and ordinary cash. Or give them away, EUNO· paper wallets make great gifts!!</p>

          <p class="intro">Helpful tips organized in ascending degrees of paranoia</p>
		  <br>
                    
      <h3><b>Keeping it Safe</b></h3>
          	<p>The biggest threat to your wallet isn't an evil WiFi packet-sniffing robot. Your worst enemy is water. If you have access to a laser printer, use it—because laser printers melt waterproof plastic (toner) onto paper instead of using ink. When using an inkjet printer, consider storing your wallet in a zip-sealing plastic bag (like those sold on this site) or printing on waterproof paper, or treating the paper with a clear coat spray like Krylon "Preserve It".
			<br><br>
			TLDR: TREAT A PAPER WALLET LIKE CASH. IF YOU LOSE IT OR IF IT BECOMES ILLEGIBLE, THE COINS ARE GONE FOREVER.</p>
            
       	  <h3><b>Withdrawing Funds</b></h3>
          <p>The private key on this wallet will let you import or "sweep" your paper wallet using this key on the EUNO· Desktop Wallet. Plan on importing your entire balance. Afterwards, discontinue using the paper wallet—as if you were breaking open a piggy bank. If you try to spend or withdraw only a portion of your funds, you risk losing the remaining balance forever.

       	  <h3><b>Going Offline</b></h3>
          <p>Your wallet may be vulnerable to prying eyes when you are generating the keys and printing them out. Although the wallet generator on this website is SSL-encrypted, it's still possible for someone to be snooping on you. (For example, your computer might have malware that broadcasts your screen to a remote location.) The most important safety measure is to go offline and run the javascript wallet generator on your own computer instead of the website.</p>
			
		<h3><b>Destroying Cache Files</b></h3>
		<p>The problem with printing out secure documents—even if your computer is 100% virus/trojan free—is that your printer driver and/or operating system may be keeping copies of the documents you print in some sort of "spool" or print queue. If a hacker or virus gets into your computer and knows to look for these cache files, then they can get your private keys and "sweep" your wallets.</p>
		
		<h3><b>Using a Clean OS</b></h3>
		<p>If you've got loads of applications on your computer, or if you use your computer for "risky behavior" (like installing freeware or visiting java / flash websites) consider dedicating a computer (or at least a bootable partition / thumbdrive / "live CD") for paper wallet printing. Never take that install online. Transfer the wallet generator ZIP file from GitHub to your clean OS using a thumbdrive or other non-networked method.</p>
		
		<h3><b>Using a Dumb Printer</b></h3>
		<p>Some advanced printers have internal storage (even hard drives) that preserve copies of printouts. This is a risk if someone gets access to your printer, or if you dispose of your printer. There is also the possibility that a smart enough printer can be hacked. This isn't quite tinfoil-hat level paranoia, as we've seen examples in the wild of viruses that rewrite the firmware of non-computer devices indirectly connected to the Internet. If this concerns you, don't use a fancy printer, and never let your printer have access to the Internet or to an Internet-connected computer.</p>
		
		<h3><b>Overwhelmed? Scared silly?</b></h3>
		<p>There's no need to follow all of these precautions. If you're just generating some give-away wallets for fun or to store small amounts of EUNO·, relax. Just use the online wallet generator on a trusted computer over a secure Internet connection. For storing larger amounts, follow as many of these security precautions as you can.</p>
